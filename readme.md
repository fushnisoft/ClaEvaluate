A very simple clarion solution that creates a console application which takes a parameter on the command line, calls the Clarion Evaluate function and returns the result to stdout.

## Example from the command prompt

```
c:\Dev\ClaEvaluate.exe "'test'"
>test

c:\Dev\ClaEvaluate.exe "Format(Today(), @D06)"
>24/10/2013

```

## C# .NET Example

Also included is an example of using this from a .NET program too.
